### Hi! 

*One dream would definetly be to make a 3D game from scratch. Not nesceseraly for profit,
more for the experience.*


**Most useful internet tip you will ever find.**

My name is Andreas and i´m a 27 year old aspiring developer.  
I live on a farm just outside of a town called Lycksele with my girlfriend, horses, dogs, cats and
some smaller animals aswell.  
I have only been programming for a few months
but can already tell that it´s something I can see myself doing in the future.  
Game programming is a big fascination that I have (as probably alot of others that starts programming).  
I haven´t done any real game projects yet but I soon feel comfortable enough to try something out.

I work parttime at an IKEA Factory in a town called Lycksele.  
There is some time managing going on but generally there is no issues with working 50% and 
studying fulltime. You just have to be dedicated and really make sure you use the school hours
effectively to get as much outcome from the day as possible.

My major interests other then working and studying involves quite exclusively:  
* Diving  
* Mountainbiking  
* Exercising  
Diving where I live is pretty worthless but we try to dive in Norway a few times per year.
